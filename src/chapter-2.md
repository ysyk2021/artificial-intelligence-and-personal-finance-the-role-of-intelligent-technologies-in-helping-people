In this chapter, we will provide a background on artificial intelligence (AI) and the fundamental concepts necessary for understanding its role in personal finance.

History of Artificial Intelligence
----------------------------------

The concept of AI dates back to the 1950s, when researchers began exploring the possibility of creating machines that could mimic human intelligence. Since then, advances in computing power and algorithms have led to significant progress in the field.

Some of the major milestones in the history of AI include:

* The development of the first AI program, the Logic Theorist, by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon in 1956
* The creation of the first chatbot, ELIZA, by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1964
* The emergence of expert systems in the 1970s, which were designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific fields
* The development of machine learning algorithms in the 1980s, which enabled computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed
* The rise of deep learning in the 2010s, which has propelled advances in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition

Types of Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------

AI can be broadly categorized into two types: narrow AI and general AI.

### Narrow AI

Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks and functions. Examples of narrow AI applications include image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These systems are trained on large amounts of data and can perform their assigned tasks with a high degree of accuracy.

### General AI

General AI, also known as strong AI, is designed to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence. This type of AI is still largely theoretical and remains a topic of active research in the field.

Machine Learning Techniques
---------------------------

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. There are several machine learning techniques that are commonly used in AI applications:

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training an algorithm on labeled data, which consists of input/output pairs. The goal is to enable the algorithm to generalize to new, unseen data by learning the underlying patterns and relationships between the input and output variables.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training an algorithm on unlabeled data, with the goal of identifying patterns and relationships within the data. This technique is often used for tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves training an algorithm to interact with an environment and learn from feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. This technique is often used for tasks such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicle control.

Conclusion
----------

Artificial intelligence has a rich history dating back to the 1950s and has seen significant progress in recent years thanks to advances in computing power and algorithms. AI can be broadly categorized into narrow AI and general AI, and there are several machine learning techniques that are commonly used in AI applications, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. By understanding these fundamental concepts, we can better appreciate the role that AI technologies play in the rapidly evolving landscape of personal finance.

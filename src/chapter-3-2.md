Financial institutions play a critical role in the personal finance landscape. These institutions provide a wide range of products and services, including:

Along with financial institutions, there are a variety of personal finance products and services that individuals can use to manage their finances, including:

* Budgeting and Expense Tracking Tools: These tools help individuals track their spending and create budgets to manage their money more effectively.

* Savings Accounts: Savings accounts allow individuals to earn interest on their money while keeping it easily accessible.

* Credit Cards: Credit cards allow individuals to make purchases on credit and pay for them over time, while also providing rewards such as cashback or airline miles.
